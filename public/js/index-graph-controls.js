 * index-graph-controls will hold pointers and calculations that service the Graph view buttons.
 * Currently, the shedDB.js holds all of the variables, but this bad idea now couples all of the
 * Device's Graph view changes. So when one Device view button is clicked, it affects all Devices.
 * Moving all of the vars and calcs from the Server to the Client will solve the problem.
